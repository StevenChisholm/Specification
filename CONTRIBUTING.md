## How to Contribute

During the early stages of protocol development we will allow direct check-in's from recognized participants on the DOE [Advanced Synchrophasor Protocol](https://energy.gov/oe/articles/oe-announces-investment-new-research-improve-grid-reliability-through-enhanced-0) (ASP) project. If you are a participant in the ASP project and would like to assist with drafting the specification, please provide your GitHub account name to the [Grid Protection Alliance](https://www.gridprotectionalliance.org/) (GPA) and we will provide you with write access to the repository.

If you are not associated with the ASP project and would still like to contribute, please send a message to the GPA at [bjmoses@gridprotectionalliance.org](bjmoses@gridprotectionalliance.org) and request that you would like to participate with drafting the specification, or simply create a pull request (PR) from a forked repository which will be considered for merging.

As the protocol moves beyond initial its draft stages, we intend to move to a PR based model for making modifications to the specification with a reduced set of participants that can approve any pull requests.

### Contributor Recognition

The contributors are listed in [AUTHORS](AUTHORS) file. If you are making a contribution to the specification, please add yourself to this file.
